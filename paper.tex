\section{Introduction}

Araya et al. modeled the flow through a VAT array using leaky Rankine bodies
\cite{Araya2014}.

Questions addressed:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Can 2-D RANS be used for array design?
    
    \item Can ALM--RANS be used for array design?

    \item Does 3-D RANS tell us more about what is happening, i.e, can it
    ``interpolate'' the experimental results?

\end{enumerate}

\section{Numerical models}

The RANS models employ a sliding mesh, where the turbine zone rotates at a mean
tip speed ratio $\lambda=1.9$ with an unsteadiness as the blade passage
frequency specified to mimic the experimental data.

To capture the boundary layer, 

\section{Model verification}

The $k$--$\omega$ SST and Spalart--Allmaras RANS model cases were verified for
convergence of the turbine mean power coefficient with respect to grid spacing
and timestep. The grid topology was fixed, but the number of cells per unit
length were scaled proportionally, maintaining the same background mesh cell
aspect ratio. Results for this parameter sweep are shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:spatial-grid-dep}, from which the final number of streamwise
grid points $N_x = 70$ was chosen.

turbulence models for fixed timesteps.}

\end{figure}

Timestep dependence was studied using the $N_x=70$ grid, the results from which
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:timestep-dep}. It was seen that the
Spalart--Allmaras model converged well with decreasing timestep, leading to a
final timestep of 0.001 s. The results from the SST model show a local minimum,
at $\Delta t = 0.002 s$, which was the final timestep chosen to run the
simulations.

\section{Model validation}

Models were validated against several open datasets.
