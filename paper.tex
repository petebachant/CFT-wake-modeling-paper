\section{Introduction}

Araya et al. modeled the flow through a VAT array using leaky Rankine bodies
\cite{Araya2014}.


\section{Numerical models}


\section{Model verification}


\section{Model validation}

Models were validated against several open datasets.


\section{Results}

\subsection{Performance prediction}

Predictions for both the power and drag coefficients are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:perf_comp}

\begin{figure}

each numerical model.}
