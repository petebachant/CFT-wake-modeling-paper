\section{Introduction}

Araya et al. modeled the flow through a VAT array using leaky Rankine bodies
\cite{Araya2014}.

In this study we set out to model the wake of the University of New Hampshire's
Reference Vertical-Axis (cross-flow) Turbine (UNH-RVAT) using a
Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes numerical model.

Questions addressed:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Can 2-D RANS be used for array design?
    
    \item Can ALM--RANS be used for array design?

    \item Does 3-D RANS tell us more about what is happening, i.e, can it
    ``interpolate'' the experimental results?

\end{enumerate}

Goals:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Evaluate modern computational fluid dynamics techniques for predicting
    the dynamic loading on cross-flow turbine blades.

    \item If possible, accurately predict the turbine from the perspective as a
    wake generator, such that the results can be used to develop low-order
    models.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Numerical models}

The flow field was modeled using the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations,
employing two different turbulence models--Menter's $k$--$\omega$ SST
\cite{Menter1994} and the Spalart--Allmaras one equation model
\cite{Spalart1992}. The SST model was chosen due to its prominence in the
literature for simulating separating flows, which we assumed to be present in
the current problem in the form of dynamic stall. The Spalart--Allmaras model
was shown by Ferreira et al. \cite{Ferreira2007} to match experimental particle
image velocimetry (PIV) results for a CFT in dynamic stall, though this was a
somewhat low Reynolds number case ($5 \times 10^4$).

\subsection{Computational mesh}

The computational domain is a rectangular volume
\todo[inline]{Add domain extent in terms of turbine diameter.}
with a cylindrical sliding mesh interface, where the turbine zone rotates at a
mean tip speed ratio $\lambda=1.9$ with a sinusoidal fluctuation at the blade
passage frequency specified to mimic the experimental data. 
\todo[inline]{Get parameters of TSR unsteadiness.}
The 2-D mesh is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mesh}.

The mesh topology is kept constant, while its refinement is controlled by a
single parameter---the number of cells in the streamwise direction, $N_x$. 

To capture the boundary layer, 20 layers are

In the 3-D mesh, layers are not added to the struts and shaft to save
computational expense.

3-D computer aided design (CAD) files of the turbine are available from
\cite{Bachant2014-RVAT-CAD}.

The 3-D mesh was also generated with \textit{OpenFOAM}'s \textit{snappyHexMesh}
application, with identical domain size, resolution, and boundary layer
parameters in the $x$--$y$ plane, and \todo[inline]{Get $N_z$ for 3-D mesh.}
cells in the vertical direction.

\subsection{Software}

Simulations were run using the \textit{pimpleDyMFoam} solver from the
open-source finite volume CFD package \textit{OpenFOAM}, version 2.3.x.

\subsection{Initial and boundary conditions}

Initial and boundary conditions were set to match those of the tow tank as well
as possible. 

\section{Model verification}

The $k$--$\omega$ SST and Spalart--Allmaras RANS model cases were verified for
convergence of the turbine mean power coefficient with respect to grid spacing
and timestep. The grid topology was fixed, but the number of cells per unit
length were scaled proportionally, maintaining the same background mesh cell
aspect ratio. Results for this parameter sweep are shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:spatial-grid-dep}, from which the final number of streamwise
grid points $N_x = 70$ was chosen.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Spatial grid dependence for the SST (a) and Spalart--Allmaras (b) 
turbulence models for fixed timesteps.}
\label{fig:spatial-grid-dep}
\end{figure}

Timestep dependence was studied using the $N_x=70$ grid, the results from which
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:timestep-dep}. It was seen that the
Spalart--Allmaras model converged well with decreasing timestep, leading to a
final timestep of 0.001 s. The results from the SST model show a local minimum,
at $\Delta t = 0.002 s$, which was the final timestep chosen to run the
simulations.

Models were validated against several open datasets.
