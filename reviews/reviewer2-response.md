# Response to reviewer 2

We thank the reviewer for his or her thoughtful comments, which have helped us
improve the paper.

>In general more work needs to be performed on
• Discussion of mesh factors that may affect the simulation results


>• Nomenclature, and the lack of definition of many of the variables will cause confusion for many readers


>• Improvement of figures with nomenclature, labels, axis etc.


>• More explanation of why the various transport properties are investigated and their applicability


>Additionally the title could be better, maybe add a Computational Fluid Dynamics or simulation somewhere?
