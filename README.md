# Numerical modeling the wake of a vertical-axis cross-flow turbine

A paper evaluating various techniques for modeling CFT wakes.

  * RANS with resolved boundary layers
  * Actuator line with and without free surface
  * More?

## What engineers should learn from this paper

  * How accurate are the various wake modeling techniques? Also, how well
    do these predict performance?
  * What is the lowest-fidelity model that produces acceptable results for
    predicting array performance?
